# UniLang

## Background

In 2016, I submitted an idea to NYCSEF Research-In-Development that I called UniLang. The plan was to create my own syntax for a programming language and have the language be converted to any other language by string conversion. Originally, I did this by breaking up the text and splitting into arrays which I would then use to search for key words.<br><br>
Later, I discovered RegEx. RegEx would have made my life a lot easier. This is my attempt at rewriting UniLang in NodeJs with Regex, to see how far programming language conversion can go.
